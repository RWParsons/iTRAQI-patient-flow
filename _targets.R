# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline # nolint

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
# library(tarchetypes) # Load other packages as needed. # nolint

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tidyverse", "sp", "sf"), # packages that your targets need to run
  format = "rds" # default storage format
  # Set other options as needed.
)

# tar_make_clustermq() configuration (okay to leave alone):
options(clustermq.scheduler = "multiprocess")

# tar_make_future() configuration (okay to leave alone):
future::plan(future.callr::callr)

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
tar_source()
# source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed. # nolint

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(
  tar_target(
    files, 
    get_files(data_dir = "U:\\Research\\Projects\\health\\jti_research_data\\jti_itraqi"), 
    format = "file"

  tar_target(
    name = data,
    command = load_data(data_files = files)
  ),
  tar_target(
    name = data,
    command = select_cohort(data_files = files)
